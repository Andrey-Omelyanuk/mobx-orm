MobX-ORM
===
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Andrey-Omelyanuk/mobx-orm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Andrey-Omelyanuk/mobx-orm)

Reactive ORM based on [mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)
Inspired by [ember-data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) and [js-data](https://github.com/js-data/js-data).

Warning: it is not mobx-orm from npm package

Check ./e2e tests for understanding how to use the lib.


# For Developers:
I recommend use docker for development. See the `makefile` file.
If you don't want to use docker then you can see `scripts` commands into `package.json`
